# Sasktel 3G Coverage (Google Maps Version) #

The idea of this little project is to make it easy to browse cities/towns to see coverage of Sasktels 3G network.
The data is crawled from http://www.sasktel.com/EndecaUI/controller/_/Tab-4294966321/Ntt-3g-rollout

Yes, Sasktel does have a coverage map (http://www.sasktel.com/personal/mobility/coverage/interactive-coverage/index.html).  I don't find it very usable at all, but I do find it's useful for scanning areas of SK (not cities/towns)

Here is an example of what I'm hoping to achieve. Feedback is welcome, and hey, how about checking out a copy and adding to it :D
